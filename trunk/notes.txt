Current state of affairs
-----------------------
TODO:
- Check: Midpointing routing of MrBayes Trees?
- Implement PhyML Webservice

Last modifications:
- Extended MrBayes Webservice to support more parameters


Current problems:
- Resubmit of MrBayes jobs currently not possible
- VAMSAS: one Topali sequence -> two Vamsas sequences just causes trouble

Some ideas:
- What's about the third import alignment option (clustal)?
- Just one settings dialog for all settings?
- Not just limit max. alignment size, also limit number of active jobs per user?
- Would it be helpfull to launch an external application from a tree panel (ATV, TreeView, etc.)?
- Load example dataset
- Import alignment from URL


VAMSAS:
- Can Jalview get the Topali data?
- What can Topali get from Jalview?

Tomcat Manager:

Misc.

To run a script in a certain queue:
#$ -q fast.q@n1

If libs changes, edit:
- j.bat (for testing)
- build.xml (generates meta-inf classpath for topali.jar) (used by installer)
- webstart/topali.jnlp
