Current state of affairs
-----------------------

Last modifications:
- Autoselect Model: After Modeltest finishes, the best BIC model will be selected automatically.
- The currently selected model will now be marked in the Modeltest table (bold font)
- Implemented a unit test for Modeltest job
- Added XSLT mechanism for backward compatibility (V. 2.16 projects will now be transformed to be 2.17 compatible)

TODO:
- Check HKY, TrN and GTR model in Model test (results differ from MrAIC results!)

Some ideas:
- Do we actually really want to reselect the sequences when resubmitting a job?
