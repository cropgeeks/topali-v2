Current state of affairs

Last modifications:
- Modified icons again
- When F84 tree job finishes, Topali now again automatically switches to tree view
- Fixed Codeml Site/Branch job resubmission and anaylsis info display
- Fixed: Default button was not working for every job settings dialog
- Added application details and literature references to jobs' analysis info 
- Repacked ATV library (forester.jar), now includes source code

TODO:

Some ideas:
- Do we actually really want to reselect the sequences when resubmitting a job?

Misc.
-----
To run a script in a certain queue:
#$ -q fast.q@n1

If libs changes, edit:
- j.bat (for testing)
- build.xml (generates meta-inf classpath for topali.jar) (used by installer)
- webstart/topali.jnlp
