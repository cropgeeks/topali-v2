Current state of affairs
-----------------------
Last modifications:
- Added vamsas read/write support for TOPALi annotations (Partitions, Coding Regions)
- Made MrBayes and Modelgenerator Webservice progress trackable
- Implemented a basic server side limit mechanism (limited alignment size)
- Added "Load example alignment" to help menu

Current problems:
- Concurrent VAMSAS sessions not possible (file lock?)

Some ideas:
- What's about the third import alignment option (clustal)?
- Just one settings dialog for all settings?
- Remove "Check for update" in Help menu (as it's done automatically)?
- Not just limit max. alignment size, also limit number of active jobs per user?
- Would it be helpfull to launch an external application from a tree panel (ATV, TreeView, etc.)?

To run a script in a certain queue:
#$ -q fast.q@n1

If libs changes, edit:
- j.bat (for testing)
- build.xml (generates meta-inf classpath for topali.jar) (used by installer)
- webstart/topali.jnlp
