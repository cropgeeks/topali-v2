Current state of affairs
-----------------------

TODO:
- If connecting to a vamsas session, and there is already a project loaded, copy project to the vamsas session. 

Current problems:
- Interapplication sequence editing doesn't work (topali or vamsas problem?)
  
Last modifications:
- VAMSAS: Removed mapper serialization again, replaced it with a "ID mechanism for all DataObjects"
- Connecting to vamsas session does not clear the current project anymore

Some ideas:


Some URLs
---------
Tomcat Manager:

Grid Report

SCRI Cluster:

Misc.
-----
To run a script in a certain queue:
#$ -q fast.q@n1

If libs changes, edit:
- j.bat (for testing)
- build.xml (generates meta-inf classpath for topali.jar) (used by installer)
- webstart/topali.jnlp
