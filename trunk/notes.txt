Current state of affairs
-----------------------

Last modifications:
- Replaced JC tree construction with F84+G (needs to be tested!)
- Added a VAMSAS icon to the toolbar, to connect to/synchronize a VAMSAS session
 

Current problems:

Some ideas:
- What's about the third import alignment option (clustal)?
- Just one settings dialog for all settings?
- Not just limit max. alignment size, also limit number of active jobs per user?
- Would it be helpfull to launch an external application from a tree panel (ATV, TreeView, etc.)?
- Load example dataset
- Import alignment from URL

Some URLs
---------
Tomcat Manager:
http://gruffalo:8080/

Grid Report
http://gruffalo/ganglia/ (doesn't work anymore?)

SCRI Cluster:
http://gruffalo.scri.ac.uk/topali
http://gruffalo.scri.ac.uk/broker



Misc.
-----
To run a script in a certain queue:
#$ -q fast.q@n1

If libs changes, edit:
- j.bat (for testing)
- build.xml (generates meta-inf classpath for topali.jar) (used by installer)
- webstart/topali.jnlp
