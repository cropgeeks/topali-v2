Current state of affairs
-----------------------

Last modifications:
- Added XSLT file for 2.18-2.19 transformation (doesn't do anything yet)
- Fixed bug: RaxML result (field: anlysis info) contained an invalid character
  (therefore project.xml will now be checked when loaded)
  

TODO:
- Bug: Dundee cluster filesystem timeout problems
- Future: Estimate Tree dialog needs defaults button
- Future: Resumbittion of tree job
- FRANK: come up with additional "TOPALi Tips"
- Applications note

Suggestions:
- Store all default values in Prefs, so that there is one central file
  were the default values can be viewed/changed.
- Topali trees: Sequence coloring (by species) (Diego Miranda, dm435@cam.ac.uk)
- Job cleanup: Check, does Topali really clean up the job directory (Jim Procter)

Known Bugs
- RaxML process sometimes doesn't stop (seems to happen on quite short alignments)
- PhyML: Sequences with nearly zero branchlengths often cause zero bootstrap support. (bug in PhyML)
