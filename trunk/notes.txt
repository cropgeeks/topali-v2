Current state of affairs
-----------------------

VAMSAS today:
- Work on tree saving to vamdoc
- Track problems/bugs to talk about tomorrow with Jim (e. g. saving project to appdata)
- Fix the ancestral sequence bug (duplicated ds sequences)

TODO:
- Rewrite VAMSAS interface
- Try to write complete topali project to vamsas document 
- Check svn!


Last modifications:
- Fixed a bug in nexus file writer (which produced a corrupt file, when selecting partitions of size n%50==0)
- Worked on vamsas stuff reimplementation (still in progress)

Current problems:

Some ideas:
- What's about the third import alignment option (clustal)? (not important at the moment)
- Just one settings dialog for all settings?
- Not just limit max. alignment size, also limit number of active jobs per user? (not an easy task)
- Would it be helpfull to launch an external application from a tree panel (ATV, TreeView, etc.)? ((not important at the moment)
- Import alignment from URL (not important at the moment)
- Spread Phyml job over several nodes (bootstrapping)? (not important at the moment)

VAMSAS TODO:
------------
- Store complete topali project to ApplicationData area in the VAMSAS document (don't store everything as annotation)
- Deal with vamsas sessions (saving/loading/creating new session)

To run a script in a certain queue:
#$ -q fast.q@n1

If libs changes, edit:
- j.bat (for testing)
- build.xml (generates meta-inf classpath for topali.jar) (used by installer)
- webstart/topali.jnlp
