Current state of affairs
-----------------------

Last modifications:
- Alignment display: Each nucleotid rectangle is now pre-painted and copied into the actual display canvas
  (instead of repainted again and again)
  Sequence and paritition dimming as well as mouse over highlighting is now done by transparent overlaying
  (instead of repainting the panel or buffer on each action)
  Also added a light color gradient to the nuc. rectangles
- Fixed update checker (version.txt in /www, upload to webserver with next release)
  (already done in previous svn commit)
- Fixed a bug in "remove bootstrap value" dialog
- Added ToolTips to various table headers
- Removed some unneccessary System.out.println()s
- Added RF tree distances to model selection webservice
- Quick Tree Estimation: Now allows setting of ts/tv and alpha parameter
- Fixed bug in model test: AIC2 and BIC score was wrong
- Removed 'Optimize...' checkboxes from phyml dialog (not needed at the moment)
- Fixed bug: AA sub. models have 0 degress of freedom not 19

TODO:
- Bug: Dundee cluster filesystem timeout problems
- Future: Estimate Tree dialog needs defaults button
- Future: Resumbittion of tree job
- FRANK: come up with additional "TOPALi Tips"
- Applications note

Some ideas:


Known Bugs
- RaxML process sometimes doesn't stop (can't reproduce this anymore...)
- PhyML: Sequences with nearly zero branchlengths often cause zero bootstrap support. (bug in PhyML)
