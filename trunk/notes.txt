Suggestions:
- Topali trees: Sequence coloring (by species) (Diego Miranda, dm435@cam.ac.uk)
- Job cleanup: Check, does Topali really clean up the job directory (Jim Procter)
- Time limit on public queue: different limit for single and parallel jobs?

Known Bugs
- RaxML process sometimes doesn't stop (seems to happen on quite short alignments)
- PhyML: Sequences with nearly zero branchlengths often cause zero bootstrap support. (bug in PhyML)
