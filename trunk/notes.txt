Current state of affairs
-----------------------

Last modifications:
- Replaced MrBayes 3.1.1 with 3.1.2 (due to a bug in 3.1.1)
- Had to move i18n stuff into src directory (otherwise NetBeans complains)
- Implemented variable window sizes in DSS and LRT
- If job entry gets removed (cancelled), the error info panel now also gets cleared.
- Resultpanels: Again just one right-aligned toolbar (no separated toolbars for each graph etc. anymore)
- Fixed: Printpreview just showed first page for multipage Printables
- ModelDiagrams are now also exportable/printable (but still some problem with printing)

TODO:
- Optimising RaxML parameters (that means running jobs prior to the actual analysis!)
- Full LRT test for selected windows
- Automatically determine window size for LRT and DSS
- Webservices for 3rd parties
- Release for UoD cluster
- Investigate SVG support?
- Bug: Dundee cluster filesystem timeout problems
- FRANK: come up with additional "TOPALi Tips"

Suggestions:
- Topali trees: Sequence coloring (by species) (Diego Miranda, dm435@cam.ac.uk)
- Job cleanup: Check, does Topali really clean up the job directory (Jim Procter)
- Time limit on public queue: different limit for single and parallel jobs?

Known Bugs
- RaxML process sometimes doesn't stop (seems to happen on quite short alignments)
- PhyML: Sequences with nearly zero branchlengths often cause zero bootstrap support. (bug in PhyML)
