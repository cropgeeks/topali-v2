Current problems:

Some ideas:
- What's about the third import alignment option (clustal)? (not important at the moment)
- Just one settings dialog for all settings?
- Not just limit max. alignment size, also limit number of active jobs per user? (not an easy task)
- Would it be helpfull to launch an external application from a tree panel (ATV, TreeView, etc.)? ((not important at the moment)
- Import alignment from URL (not important at the moment)
- Spread Phyml job over several nodes (bootstrapping)? (not important at the moment)

To run a script in a certain queue:
#$ -q fast.q@n1

If libs changes, edit:
- j.bat (for testing)
- build.xml (generates meta-inf classpath for topali.jar) (used by installer)
- webstart/topali.jnlp
