Current state of affairs
-----------------------

Last modifications:
- Updated help texts
- Updated "what's new" part for topali website
- Created a little "framework" for running small threads (e.g. quick tree estimation) locally on the desktop
  ("killable" thread class, showing "please wait" dialogs, etc.) (package var.threads)
- Created workaround for loosing bootstrap values when midpoint rooting trees with PAL.
- Improved ModelDiagram graphics

TODO:
- Check if writing back bootstrap values after midpoint rooting really works.
- Increase table font size
- UpdateChecker doesn't work anymore
- Implement/decide on analysis restrictions for remote jobs
- Bug: Dundee cluster filesystem timeout problems
- Future: Estimate Tree dialog needs defaults button
- Future: Resumbittion of tree job
- Future: Decide on mouse highlighting functionality
- Future: Decide on how to handle local job submission
- FRANK: come up with additional "TOPALi Tips"
- Applications note

Some ideas:


Known Bugs
- RaxML process sometimes doesn't stop
- PhyML: Sequences with nearly zero branchlengths often cause zero bootstrap support. (bug in PhyML)
