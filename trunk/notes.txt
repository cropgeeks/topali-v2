Current state of affairs
-----------------------

Last modifications:
- Moved all i18n texts in one file (i18n.properties)
- Added language option in DisplaySettings dialog
- Started translation to German
- Fixed bug in Phyml sge-script

TODO:
- DSS/LRT gap threshold: Check with Frank again!
- Bug: Dundee cluster filesystem timeout problems
- FRANK: come up with additional "TOPALi Tips"

Suggestions:
- Store all default values in Prefs, so that there is one central file
  were the default values can be viewed/changed.
- Topali trees: Sequence coloring (by species) (Diego Miranda, dm435@cam.ac.uk)
- Job cleanup: Check, does Topali really clean up the job directory (Jim Procter)


Known Bugs
- RaxML process sometimes doesn't stop (seems to happen on quite short alignments)
- PhyML: Sequences with nearly zero branchlengths often cause zero bootstrap support. (bug in PhyML)
