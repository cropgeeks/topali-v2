Current state of affairs
-----------------------
TODO:
- Check Sub. models
 
Last modifications:
- Implemented fast WAG/NJ tree for protein alignments
- Changed webservice limit from total number of bases to number of sequences 
- Added "Load example alignment" option to "Import alignment" dialog
- Added MrBayes cDNA tree estimation

Current problems:
- Midpoint routing results in loosing bootstrap values
- VAMSAS: one Topali sequence -> two Vamsas sequences just causes trouble

Some ideas:
- What's about the third import alignment option (clustal)? (not important at the moment)
- Just one settings dialog for all settings?
- Not just limit max. alignment size, also limit number of active jobs per user? (not an easy task)
- Would it be helpfull to launch an external application from a tree panel (ATV, TreeView, etc.)? ((not important at the moment)
- Import alignment from URL (not important at the moment)
- Spread Phyml job over several nodes (bootstrapping)? (not important at the moment)

To run a script in a certain queue:
#$ -q fast.q@n1

If libs changes, edit:
- j.bat (for testing)
- build.xml (generates meta-inf classpath for topali.jar) (used by installer)
- webstart/topali.jnlp
