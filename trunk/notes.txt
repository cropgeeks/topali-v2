Some ideas:



Some URLs
---------
Tomcat Manager:
http://gruffalo:8080/

Grid Report
http://gruffalo/scri/ganglia/

SCRI Cluster:

Misc.
-----
To run a script in a certain queue:
#$ -q fast.q@n1

If libs changes, edit:
- j.bat (for testing)
- build.xml (generates meta-inf classpath for topali.jar) (used by installer)
- webstart/topali.jnlp
