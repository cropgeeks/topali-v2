Current state of affairs
-----------------------

Last modifications:
- Added ModelTestProcess extends StoppableProcess (MT local jobs can now be properly cancelled)
- MrBayes Summary is now added to "Analysis Info".
- MrBayes: User will be warned if a PSRF value is greater than 1.2
- MrBayes and PhyML settings will now be stored in Preferences
- Replaced PhyML with PhyML-aLRT (because PhyML won't do bootstrapping with custom models)
- Added some images showing model details, gamma dist. and inv. sites to ModelInfoPanel
- Alignment can be splitted into 3, according to codon positions (already added some time ago)
- Wrote unit test for MathUtils class (already added some time ago)


TODO:
- Check HKY, TrN and GTR model in Model test (results differ from MrAIC results!)
- UpdateChecker doesn't work anymore
