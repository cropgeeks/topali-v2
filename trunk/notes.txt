Current state of affairs
-----------------------

Last modifications:
- Extended ParamEstThread from DesktopThread (now it's cancellable)
  (therefore removed ParamEstDialog because now a DefaultWaitDialog is used instead)
- Added "Estimate Parameters" option to QuickTreeDialog
- Fixed DSS/LRT gap threshold (in case everything except less than 4 sequences are removed due to 
  exceeding gap threshold)
- Moved XML property settings from Castor.java to Topali.java, because of some XML serializer 
  errors when saving projects (saving a Topali project does not instantiate Castor.java!)
- Fixed bug: Phyml and MrBayes dialog throw error after parameter estimation
- Fixed MrBayes job resubmission


TODO:
- DSS/LRT gap threshold: Check with Frank again!
- Bug: Dundee cluster filesystem timeout problems
- Future: Resumbittion of tree job
- FRANK: come up with additional "TOPALi Tips"
- Applications note

Suggestions:
- Store all default values in Prefs, so that there is one central file
  were the default values can be viewed/changed.
- Topali trees: Sequence coloring (by species) (Diego Miranda, dm435@cam.ac.uk)
- Job cleanup: Check, does Topali really clean up the job directory (Jim Procter)
- Check parameter estimation again. (Quick tree with estimated parameters produces worse
  bootstrap values than with fixed tstv=2, alpha=4 parameters)

Known Bugs
- RaxML process sometimes doesn't stop (seems to happen on quite short alignments)
- PhyML: Sequences with nearly zero branchlengths often cause zero bootstrap support. (bug in PhyML)

Misc.
-----
To run a script in a certain queue:
#$ -q fast.q@n1

If libs changes, edit:
- j.bat (for testing)
- build.xml (generates meta-inf classpath for topali.jar) (used by installer)
- webstart/topali.jnlp

Release
-------
- Set TOPALi.debug = false
- Set logger level to warn/error
- Build TOPALi
- Create installers (check JRE bundling)
- Build/deploy public topali server:
	ant -Dproperties=build.scri-public.properties update
- Upload installers
- Sign and upload jars for WebStart
- Update website (whatsnew/index.html and version.txt)
