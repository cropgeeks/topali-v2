Current state of affairs
-----------------------

Last modifications:
- Added new model testing webservice based on phyml (removed modelgenerator from the menu)
- Added highlighting/tooltip functionality to CustomTable

TODO:
- Write unit test for model test webservice
- Implement a method for importing old topali projects (XSLT?)
  (because topali.xml has changed again)

Some ideas:
- Do we actually really want to reselect the sequences when resubmitting a job?
