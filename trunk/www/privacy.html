<h1>TOPALi Privacy Policy</h1>


<p>Although TOPALi runs on your local PC, its analysis methods are submitted (via web services)
to remote high-performance compute clusters. This requires that the data you are working on be
submitted too.</p>

<p>As part of a remote job submission, we also record:
<ul>
<li>The IP address of the machine making the connection (so we know (roughly) where in the world TOPALi
is being used</li>
<li>The type of job requested (whether PDM, DSS, etc)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Your data, once on the remote system, is stored locally during processing. It is fully deleted
upon successful job completion when TOPALi requests the results be sent back to it. Data from
a failed job will remain on the system for 3 days (to help us with bug tracking if necessary).
Data from a successful job where TOPALi has yet to request it be sent back is kept for 30 days.
</p>

<p>This data is currently sent compressed, but unencrypted over an insecure HTTP connection. If
you have a strong requirement for data privacy then we suggest you DO NOT run TOPALi's services
as remote jobs. Use local job submission only.</p>
