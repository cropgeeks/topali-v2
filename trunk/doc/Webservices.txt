How to implement a new JOB
-------------------------

Directory structure:

topali
	/cluster
		/jobs
			/JOB
				/analysis
				JOBAnalysis
				JOBProcess
				...
			JOBInitializer
			JOBMonitor
			JOBWebservice			
		JOBRemoteJob
		JOBLocalJob

1) JOBInitializer extends Thread
Set up everything the job needs to run, e.g. create
directories, write the sequences to a file, store the
JOBResult (containing various parameters for the job).
At the end of the overriden run() method launch the job:
if(remote)
	JOBWebservice.runscript()
else
	JOBAnalysis.start()
	
	
2) JOBAnalysis extends AnalysisThread
This class runs the actual analysis, e.g. by launching
external applications via JOBProcess.
Has to override runAnalysis().

3) JOBProcess extends StoppableProcess
External applications should be wrapped in this class, 
to provide a proper cancel mechanism.
