<h1>Exporting Alignments</h1>

<p>Exporting an alignment allows you to take data from TOPALi and save it externally
in one of the file formats supported by the program. You can also choose whether to
export an entire alignment, or just a certain region of it, or only certain sequences
from it (or a combination of both).</p>

<p>To export an alignment, first ensure it is visible in the main window, and then
select <b>File | Export Alignment</b> from the menu bar.</p>

<p><b>Sequence selection:</b><br>
Choose which sequences from the original alignment should be included. If you only
wish to export a subset of sequences, you must first ensure they are selected
before opening the <b>Export Alignment</b> dialog.
</p>

<p><b>Alignment length:</b><br>
Choose which region of the alignment should be exported. Sub regions can be exported
by first ensuring they have been selected (and the relavent section highlighted)
using the <a href="partitions_dialog.html">Paritions Dialog</a>. You can also export
an alignment that is a concatenation of all of the currently selected partitions.
</p>

<p><b>Export options:</b><br>
Exporting an alignment to a file on disk will open a standard file chooser dialog
allowing you to select where the file should be saved and the format to save it in.
<br>
Adding the alignment as a new alignment in TOPALi will add it as a new alignment
within the same project that the current alignment is open in. This second option
is a good option to select if you want to remove certain regions or sequences from
an alignment and compare analyses results generated against the new alignment with
those from the original alignment.
<br>
You can also split the alignment into three alignments according to codon positions
(if your alignment consists of DNA and is divisible by three). These three alignments
will be added to your current project, which gives you the opportunity to analyse
these alignments separately (e. g. estimate a best fitting substitution model for each
codon position).
