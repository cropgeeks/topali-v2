<h1>Partitioning</h1>

<p>Working with partitions involves the use of the Current Partitions dialog, accessible
by selecting <b>Alignment | Show Partitions Dialog</b> from the menu bar.</p>

<p>A <i>partition</i> is defined as any region of the current alignment, and 
contains both a starting nucleotide and an ending nucleotide. Splitting an
alignment up into multiple partitions allows you to more easily
analyze the various regions, and perform additional tasks upon them such as
estimating phylogenetic trees relate only to that region and not the alignment
as a whole.</p>

<p>The Current Partitions dialog lists all defined partitions for an alignment,
and also provides a Jukes Cantor/Neighbor Joining phylogenetic tree preview of the 
currently selected partition.</p>

<p><b>Working with partitions:</b><br>
The dialog contains several buttons for working with partitions:
<ul>
  <li><b>New</b> - manually specific a new partition.</li>
  <li><b>Edit</b> - edit selected partition.</li>
  <li><b>Auto Partition</b> - <a href="auto_partition.html">automatically create partitions</a>
based on analysis results.</li>
  <li><b>Remove</b> - remove selected partition from list.</li>
  <li><b>Remove All</b> - remove all partitions from list.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Two shortcut buttons for other commonly used TOPALi functions are located here
too:
<ul>
  <li><b>Export</b> - <a href="export_alignment.html">export selected partition</a> to disk.</li>
  <li><b>Create Tree</b> - <a href="estimate_tree.html">estimate phylogenetic tree</a> from partition.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Viewing partitions:</b><br>
In addition to the JC/NJ tree preview, the currently selected partition will also
be mirrored in TOPALi's Alignment View by dimming regions of the alignment outwith
the selected partition's start and end points. Similarly, result sets that show
a graph plotted against alignment length will highlight the current partition in a
lighter colour.</p>

<p><b>Selecting partitions:</b><br>
In addition to creating partitions manually, it is also possible to create a new
partition by selecting it directly from compatible graphs.</p>

<p>To define a new partition click and hold the left-mouse button over the graph,
then drag left or right with the mouse until the partition highlighting covers
the desired region. Release the mouse to confirm the new partition.</p>

<p>Note that partitions created in this way are not automatically added to the
Current Partitions dialog. To do this, click the <b>Add Selection as New
Partition</b> button located on the graph's toolbar.</p>
