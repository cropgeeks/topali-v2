<h1>Phylogenetic Overviews</h1>

<p>TOPALi's Phylogenetic Overview feature is designed to give you a feel
for an alignment by providing the ability to view phylogenetic trees for
set window sizes as you move along the alignment.</p>

<p>To bring up the Phylogenetic Overview dialog, selecting <b>Alignment |
Phylogenetic Overview</b> from the menu bar.</p>

<p>The dialog allows you to view a Jukes Cantor/Neighbor Joining tree for every 
window position within the alignment (based on the window settings specified).
VCR-like playback controls are also provided to run an animation 
that displays every tree automatically.</p>

<p><b>Controlling parameters</b><br>
The number of trees that can be drawn is based on the number of windows that 
are available. By adjusting the current window size using the
<b>Window size</b> control you can specify how many 
windows the alignment will be partitioned into.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Step size</b> - step size (in nucleotides) to use when moving along the 
  alignment</li>
  <li><b>Window size</b> - window size (in nucleotides) to use when creating 
  each tree</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Modifying either of these values will adjust the slider control under the 
tree window, allowing it to select (for display) more or less windows. The
<b>Window position</b> label under the slider gives the 
current window position, along with the nucleotide starting and ending values 
for that window.</p>

<p><b>Playing animations</b><br>
You can also animate the tree, and watch how it changes as the window moves 
over the alignment. To accomplish this, first select a suitable window and step 
size, then decide upon the <b>Delay</b> time (in milliseconds) that each tree will be 
visible for. You can then use the animation buttons to control playback.
<ul>
  <li><b>Restart</b> - return the animation to the beginning (moving the window 
    back to its initial position)</li>
  <li><b>Step Back One Window</b> - move the window back one (step size) 
    increment</li>
  <li><b>Stop</b> - stop the animation that is currently playing</li>
  <li><b>Play</b> - start (or restart) the animation from the current window 
    position</li>
  <li><b>Step Forward One Window</b> - move the window forward one (step size) 
    increment</li>
</ul>
</p>
