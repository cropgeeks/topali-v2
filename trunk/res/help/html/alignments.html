<h1>Alignments</h1>

<p>TOPALi is an application designed for working with DNA (and in a future
version) Protein Multiple Alignments. Therefore, before you can perform any
analyses with the software, you must <a href="import_alignment.html">import an alignment</a> into TOPALi.</p>

<p>Each alignment that is imported is listed in TOPALi's Navigation Tree.
For each dataset, you will see the alignment itself, plus placeholders for
any phylogenetic trees and (other) analysis results that can be generated from
the alignment.</p>

<p>TOPALi can import and work with more than one alignment at once. There is no
upper limit other than your computer's available memory.</p>
