<p>Run one of the three recombination detection algorithms by selecting it from the <b>Analysis</b>
menu. HMM is suitable for 4 sequences only, PDM is suitable for 4-10 sequences and DSS for 4+
sequences.</p>

<p>Choose suitable window and step sizes for the method. Too big a window and the method might
miss likely recombination, too small a window and the results will be too noisy.</p>
