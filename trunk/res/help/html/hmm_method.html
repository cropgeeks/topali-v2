<h1>Hidden Markov Model</h1>

<p>An HMM approach can be applied to the problem
of detecting recombination in small alignments (number of sequences =
4). The mean distance between recombination breakpoints is modelled by
the probability of a recombination event as we move along the sequence
alignment. For the four sequences, there are three possible tree
(unrooted) topologies.</p>

<p>The transitions between the three topologies are assigned
probabilities. The hidden states of the HMM represent the different
phylogenetic tree topologies: we observe the sequences but cannot
directly see the "hidden" tree topologies. The parameters of the model,
namely the branch lengths associated with each topology and the
recombination probability, are optimized in a maximum likelihood sense
by applying the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The HMM method
focuses only on topology changes in the alignment, and attempts to
reduce rate heterogeneity effects. Statistical significance is assessed
by (posterior) probabilities assigned to each topology for each
position in the alignment.</p>
