<h1>CodeML site model settings</h1>
<br>
The testing for positive selection involves comparing a null hypothesis
of no selection with the alternative hypothesis of positive
selection. The PAML codeml program provides three pairs of
model with increasing complexity, so we can test M0 v M3, M1a v M2a and
M7 v M8. TOPALi allows you to choose any or all of these
pairs.<br>
<br>
Each model has initial values that you can change, as the analysis can
get stuck in a local optimum. Models M2a and M8 are particularly
likely to have this problem, so we run several jobs with
different values (following the advice in the PAML documentation).<br>
<br>
TOPALi this runs many jobs (e.g. one M0, one M3, one M1a, six M2a, one
M7, six M8) simultaneously (if running remotely on the HPC
cluster). The simpler models (e.g. M0) will run quickest, but
there will be a delay while the longer jobs run. The longer jobs
can take several hours, but we can not predict in advance how long they
will take. We recommend you analyse a subset of sequences (e.g.
10 sequences from a 50 sequence alignment) to get an idea of how long
the full analysis will take.<br>
<br>
The output is similar to the standard table produced in papers that use
PAML, listing models, parameter values, likelihoods, and results of
Likelihood Ratio Tests to compare the pairs of models.<br>
