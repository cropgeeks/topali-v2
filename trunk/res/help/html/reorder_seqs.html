<h1>Reordering Sequences</h1>

<p>The display order of sequences can be reordered to aid visual navigation of
an alignment file.</p>

<p>To do this, first <a href="select_seqs.html">select the sequences</a>
you want to move. These sequences can then be moved up or down the display
area by selecting <b>Alignment | Move Sequences Up</b> or <b>Alignment | Move Sequences Down</b>
from the menu bar. A third option, <b>Alignment | Move Sequences to Top</b>
will move the selected sequences to the top of the grouping.</p>

<p>Note than in addition to visually reordering the sequences, their new
positions within the alignment will be reflected in any output files
that are <a href="export_alignment.html">exported</a> from the project, such as saving the alignment under
a new name or in a different alignment format.</p>
