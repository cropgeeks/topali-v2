<h1>CodeML branch model settings</h1>
<br>
Using PAML codeml to test for differences in the rate of
evolution between branches on a tree is not a simple
task. Using the original codeml program, you are required
to edit a tree file to mark which branches you want to compare.
We suggest (insist, maybe) that you read the PAML demo pdf (see
references in PAML/Codeml section). Once you see how you do it in
the original PAML codeml program, you will understand how to do it in
TOPALi.<br>
<br>
TOPALi shows you a tree "hypothesis" - this is the null
hypothesis. You are required to create additional
hypotheses. To do this click "Add". You will then see a
tree diagram. You can click on the internal nodes and insert
(e.g.) #1 beside the "seq name". This will seem odd
to you unless you have read the PAML demo pdf. If you have read
it, you will understand why you use "#1" and you will just find it odd
that you type it beside the "seq name". Then you click "okay" and
then you kill the tree window. You should see that a second tree
hypothesis has been added to the list. You can add other tree
hypotheses if you wish. When you have completed setting up your
hypotheses, click "run".<br>
<br>
TOPALi will then carry out the analysis and produce tables with the
parameter values for each tree hypotheses. and carry out the Likelihood
Ratio Test(s) to compare hypotheses. If you click on "hypthesis
tested" icons (e.g. H0) then you will see a tree diagram with the
branch lengths.<br>
