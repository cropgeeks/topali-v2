New Features since last public release:

- Print preview
  - printing of graphs, trees, tables
- Mouse over highlighting allowing vamsas integration and sequence/parition selection
- (Coding region partitions)
- In addition to 4 recom/detect methods, package now contains:
  - 2 positive selection analysis methods
  - improved local tree calculations method (F84 over JC)
  - 3 new remove tree calculation types
- Rerooting of trees
- Ancestral sequences (trees)
- Model selection analysis for determing tree analysis
- Vamsas

(there must be more?)

  - [NF] Mouse highlighting (is it worth to mention that?)
  - [NF] Failed jobs now clear from the cluster as soon as they are detected,
    rather than waiting on the user to delete them.
  - [NF] New Webservice "Codon Usage Analysis", which uses CodonW to analyse
    Codon Usage.
  - [NF] New Webservice "Subst. Model Test", which uses Modelgenerator to find
    the most appropriate DNA/AA substitution model.
  - [NF] MrBayes Webservice can now create trees from DNA as well as protein
    sequence alignments, and accepts more parameters (DNA/AA models, invariant
    sites, gamma).
  - [NF] New methods for positive selection (CodeML site model and branch model
    analysis)
  - [NF] The job status panel will now tell you what position in the queue (on
    the remote cluster) you job is currently in while waiting to run.
  - [NF] Improvements to job feedback (finer percentage levels) for LRT and DSS
    analysis jobs.
  - [NF] The old "Partitions" dialog has been split into a generic annotations
    viewer, with separate sections for Paritions and Coding Regions (so far).
  - [NF] Alignment selections can now be carried out using the main alignment
    view window.
  - [NF] Cleaned up the job progress screen, allowing for a double-click to
    cancel a job.
  - [BF] TOPALi is now compatible with Java 1.6 after fixing multidimensional
    array issues with the Castor XML package. This has changed the XML project
    format again though, so projects created in versions earlier than 2.16 will
    no longer load. Project files have also been reduced in size.
  - [BF] Updated the timer threads for the job progress screen so that jobs with
    indeterminate progress bars are properly displayed.
  - [NF] Updated the export dialog so alignments can now be created/exported by
    concatenating together one or more of the currently selected partitions.
  - [NF] Updated help for several topics.
  - [NF] Improved the rendering speed of the charts while highlighting regions.
  - [NF] TOPALi can now use ReadSeq (remotely) for additional sequence-format
    compatibility.
