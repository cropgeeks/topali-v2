TOPALi "Helper" Applications

TOPALi requires the use of several external applications for performing
some of its analyses. These programs are pre-compiled and distributed
with TOPALi for Windows and Mac OS users, but for other systems they must
be compiled separately (using the included makefiles).

To install, simply change to the /binaries/unix folder and type:
  sh compileprogs
