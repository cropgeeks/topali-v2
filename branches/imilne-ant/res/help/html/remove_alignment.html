<h1>Removing Alignments</h1>

<p>To remove an alignment from a TOPALi project, you must first select its name
using the Navigation Tree (down the left-hand side of the screen). You can then
select <b>Alignment | Remove Alignment</b> from the menu bar.</p>

<p>Note that removing an alignment removes not only the alignment, but everything
associated with it too, including any generated phylogenetic trees or other analysis
results.</p>
