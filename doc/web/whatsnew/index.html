<p><b>New and improved graphical user interface</b>
<p>TOPALi v2 sports an entirely new graphical user interface that has been redesigned from scratch
to improve upon the original TOPALi's interface. On Windows, the interface blends in with Office
using the Office Look and Feel, while on Unix or Linux the popular JGoodies "Looks" is used.</p>

<p><b>Work with multiple, multiple alignments</b>
<p>A TOPALi project can now import and deal with as many DNA/Protein alignments as your PC has
memory for. Each alignment in listed in a new "tree" view down the left-hand side of the screen,
along with all the analysis results that relate to that dataset.</p>
