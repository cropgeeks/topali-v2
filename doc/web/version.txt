  - [SC] DRMAA now used for cluster control (which should also reduce the number

  - [BF] Fixed a bug where the output from a qsub job submission was read before
    the buffer was complete, which resulted in a failed submission.
  - [BF] Fixed a bug where PDM and HMM jobs could cause an XML premature end of
