<h1>Finding Sequences</h1>

<p>To locate and display a particular sequence within an alignment, select <b>
Alignment | Find Sequence</b> from the menu bar. This brings up the Find Sequence
dialog.</p>

<p>To search for a sequence, enter its exact name into the text box. Two additional
options are also provided to help customize the search:
<ul>
  <li><b>Select this sequence if it is found</b> - ensures that the sequence being
         searching for becomes the only selected sequence.</li>
  <li><b>Match case</b> - perform a case-sensitive name search.</li>
</ul>
</p>
