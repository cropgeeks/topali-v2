<h1>cDNA and Guide Protein</h1>

<p>Protein multiple alignment algorithms produce better results than do DNA multiple
alignment algorithms. Therefore if you have protein coding DNA, it is better to align
the corresponding protein sequences and then use the protein multiple alignment to
guide the cDNA alignment.</p>

<p>To do this, TOPALi needs a file containing the aligned protein sequences and a file
containing the UNALIGNED cDNA sequences.</p>

<p>Please check carefully that each DNA sequence is exactly three times the length of
the corresponding protein sequence (e.g. 900bp and 300aa). TOPALi will then produce a
protein-guided cDNA alignment.</p>
