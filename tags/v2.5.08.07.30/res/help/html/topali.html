<h1>TOPALi Overview</h1>

<p>TOPALi was primarily designed to run statistical methods that detect likely points
of recombination in DNA multiple alignments. Over time, it has grown to include the
ability to carry out additional phylogenetic analyses and currently provides a complete
environment for viewing and working with alignments and the results generated from them.</p>

<p>TOPALi v2.5 expands upon TOPALi by allowing for the remote execution of many of these
analyses jobs through the use of web services. High-performance Linux computing clusters
located at the <b>University of Dundee</b> and the <b>Scottish Crop Research Institute</b> together
provide over one hundred CPUs that are available for publically submitted jobs. TOPALi v2.5
further improves upon v1's analyses by allowing the jobs to run in parallel where
possible, significantly reducing the time required for a job to complete.</p>

<p>TOPALi v2.5 allows the user to import and work with more than one alignment per TOPAli
project. Each alignment forms the basis of a <i>dataset</i>, with each dataset being
listed down the left-hand side of TOPALi's main window in an area referred to as the
<i>Navigation Tree</i>. A dataset provides links for viewing its alignment, any
phylogenetic trees that have been estimated from the alignment, and any analysis
results from the various methods within TOPALi that can be run upon an alignment.</p>

<p>Each of the analysis methods can be run in one of two ways, either locally - using
your own computer's resourses - or remotely, using the resourses of the clusters mentioned
above. The latter option is generally faster, however there may be times when you wish
to keep all processing local, perhaps due to privacy issues or the lack of an internet
connection. Note that when <a href="local_jobs.html">running tasks locally</a>, methods
that have been designed to run in parallel may still do so if you have two or more CPUs
in your machine.</p>

<p>Once a job is complete, its results are added to the Navigation Tree, where they can
be viewed and (usually) interacted with further. TOPALi will remember the settings provided
for every analysis run - this allows you to run a new task using the parameters from an
existing result (with modifications if required). This feature exists because many of the
statistical methods may require some experimentation with before suitable settings for
your dataset are found.</p>
