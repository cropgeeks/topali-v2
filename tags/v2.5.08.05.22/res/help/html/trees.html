<h2>Exporting Trees</h2>
You can export a tree as PNG graphics file or as text file in New Hampshire format.<br>
If you have defined certain <a href="trees.html#group_clusters">Group Clusters</a>, you can also export this information into a text file.

<h2>Change Tree Style</h2>
There are three ways to display the tree:
<ul>
<li>Phenogram: The usual left to right tree</li>
<li>Circular: Nodes are arranged in a circular way</li>
<li>New Hampshire: Shows the tree in the New Hampshire text format</li>
</ul>
Apart from that, you can also display the tree in its' own window (independet from the TOPALi window) by
clicking on the <b>Toogle Tree Display</b> button. If you close this external window, the tree will be
displayed in the TOPALi window again.


<h2>Bootstrap Values</h2>
Especially on a big tree you might not want to display each single bootstrap value. <br>
Therefore you can remove bootstrap values below a certain threshold. You also have the option
to replace the remaining bootstrap values with another character. <br>
The existing tree will not be replaced, a new tree with the removed/replaced bootstrap values will
be added to your alignment.

<h2>Rooting</h2>
Some tree estimation methods will produce a typical top-left to bottom-right tree, which is sometimes 
a bit hard to read. By clicking on the <b>Reroot</b> button you can midpoint these trees. <br>
The existing tree will not be replaced, a new midpoint rooted tree will be added to your alignment.

<h2><a name="group_clusters"/>Group Clusters</h2>
By using the <b>Group Cluster</b> button you can set a certain clustering threshold.<br>
TOPALi will then create different groups according to this threshold. And you have the choice
to automatically select the first sequence of each of the groups. This is very usefull for
pruning down big alignments.

<h2>Launch Jobs</h2>
If you have estimated a bayesian or maximum likelihood tree, you can directly launch the ancestral
sequence estimation from the tree.
