<h1>HMM Settings</h1>

<p>HMM stands for <i><a href="hmm_method.html">Hidden Markov Model</a></i>.</p>

<p>Please ensure that exactly 4 sequences have been selected from your 
alignment before attempting to run HMM. See <a href="select_seqs.html">
selecting sequences</a> for further information.</p>

<p>To run the HMM analysis method, select <b>Analysis | Run HMM</b> from the menu
bar. This brings up the Settings dialog that provides several sets of parameters
that can be customized before starting the HMM run.</p>

<p><b>Topology structure:</b><br>
Topology structure settings are available by selecting the <b>Topology Structure</b>
tabbed pane. This allows you to define a prediction about the topology structure of the
alignment before the analysis actually runs. TOPALi will estimate a suitable structure
for you, but you may wish to edit it further.</p>

<p>To add a new structure partition, first click the <b>Add Breakpoint</b> button. This
will add a new record to the table that must be further edited to complete the definition.</p>

<p>The <b>Breakpoint</b> field defines the nucleotide position where the new partition will
end. Partitions are assumed to start either from the beginning of the alignment, or from
the end of the preceding partition if a partition already exists whose endpoint value is
lower than the new partition's.</p>

<p>The <b>Topology</b> field defines what the topology for the new partition will be.
As there are only 4 sequences, the maximum of tree topologies is 3, and one of these 3
must be chosen. The topologies are listed as 1, 2, and 3, along with the names of the
sequences that form them.</p>
