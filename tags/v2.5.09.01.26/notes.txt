Current state of affairs
-----------------------

Last modifications:
- Implemented a new Annotation framework
- Alignments can be joined together (ImportDialog)
- Alignments can be renamed
- DNA can be translated to Protein


TODO:
- Multiple Loci support
- Generalize selection of sequences of groups
- Release for UoD cluster
- Raxml: Optimise parameters; check new Raxml version
- SOWH test
- Molecular clock test
- Implement Wolfgang's new HMM method
- Automatically determine window sizes for LRT and DSS
- Make webservices available for third parties (first: simple tree webservice using mrbayes(?))
- Modify methods to also work with SNP data
- Translation option int the export menu
- Editing functions (like in Topali v 1)


Suggestions:
- Topali trees: Sequence coloring (by species) (Diego Miranda, dm435@cam.ac.uk)
- Job cleanup: Check, does Topali really clean up the job directory (Jim Procter)
- Time limit on public queue: different limit for single and parallel jobs?

Known Bugs
- "Remove Alignment" doesn't clear the alignment overview
- RaxML process sometimes doesn't stop (seems to happen on quite short alignments)
- PhyML: Sequences with nearly zero branchlengths often cause zero bootstrap support. (bug in PhyML)

Misc.
-----
To run a script in a certain queue:
#$ -q fast.q@n1

If libs changes, edit:
- j.bat (for testing)
- build.xml (generates meta-inf classpath for topali.jar) (used by installer)
- webstart/topali.jnlp

Release
-------
- Set TOPALi.debug = false
- Set logger level to warn/error
- Build TOPALi
- Create installers (check JRE bundling)
- Build/deploy public topali server:
	ant -Dproperties=build.scri-public.properties update
- Upload installers
- Sign and upload jars for WebStart
- Update website (whatsnew/index.html and version.txt)
