<h1>Auto Partitioning</h1>

<p>Alignment partitions can be created automatically, based on the threshold levels of
existing (compatible) analysis results sets.</p>

<p>To do this, select <b>Analysis | Auto-Partition Alignment</b> from the menu bar, or click
the <b>Auto Partition</b> button on the Current Partitions dialog. Either option will
bring up the Auto-Partition Alignment dialog.</p>

<p>This lists all results that can be partitioned (those that contain
significance threshold lines). The result set chosen will be the set used to
break up the alignment based on the midpoints between points that cut the threshold.
As very small partitions may be meaningless, an option exists to discard partitions
whose length is less than the chosen value.</p>
