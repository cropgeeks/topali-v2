<h1>Viewing Alignments</h1>

<p>The Alignment View provides information on the actual sequence data (colour coded
to the settings specified within the <a href="display_settings.html">Display Settings</a>
dialog). Moving the mouse over any site will provide its exact column number in the status
bar along the bottom, whereas hovering the mouse over a site will provide this information
as a tooltip.</p>

<p>Further information to help with viewing the data is provided along the top of the sequence
area, showing both site positions (every 25 base pairs), as well as ClustalX-style '*' information
that prints a '*' whenever every nucleotide in a column is identical.</p>

<p>Each sequence is displayed alongside its name. When a new project is created, all sequences
will be selected by default, but <a href="select_seqs.html">sub-selections</a> can also be
picked manually with the mouse.</p>
