<h1>Renaming Sequences</h1>

<p>To rename a sequence, first select it from the sequence list with the mouse,
then select <b>Alignment | Rename Sequence</b> from the menu bar. This brings up the
Rename Sequence dialog. You can then enter a new name for the sequence.</p>

<p>Note that TOPALi will only accept names that are:
<ul>
  <li>Unique within the current alignment.</li>
  <li>Do not contain space characters.</li>
  <li>Do not contain characters (such as parentheses) that could cause problems if the sequence
is exported to an external application.</li>
</ul>
</p>
