<h1>Analysis Settings</h1>

<p>The <b>Analysis Settings</b> dialog contains globally-applied settings that
relate to various options used by TOPALi while running analyses.</p>

<p><b>Web/Cluster:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>TOPALi web services</b> - holds the location of the remote TOPALi
analysis server that jobs will be submitted to.</li>
<li><b>Check job progress every</b> - specifies the time in seconds between
status checks of jobs' progress (both local and remote).</li>
<li><b>Check for updated versions of TOPALi at program startup</b> - if selected,
will cause TOPALi to connect to the internet and query for newer versions each
time the program is loaded.</li>
<li><b>Use a proxy server for all web connections</b> - if selected, ensures
that all internet requests made by TOPALi are redirected via the specified proxy
server. If NTLM (domain) authentication is required, it can be used by entering
the username in the form "DOMAIN\username" into the <b>Username</b> field.
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Local Job Settings:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>TOPALi temporary working directory</b> - lists how much disk space
TOPALi has used for running local jobs. The files can be deleted by pressing the
<b>Clear</b> button.</li>
<li><b>Maximum number of CPU/Cores to use for local jobs</b> - specifies how
many concurrent threads will be run together for local jobs. A higher number 
will result in faster job completion (for analysis jobs that can be run in
parallel) but will leave little resource for other non TOPALi tasks your PC is
running.</li>
</ul>
Note that neither of the above two settings are available for modification if
TOPALi is currently running locally submitted jobs.
