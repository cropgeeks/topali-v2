<h1>What's New in TOPALi v2</h1>

<p>TOPALi v2 is an ongoing project, and as such the software is
updated often. Below is a list
of new or interesting features that have been added to the application
in recent days, weeks,
months...</p>

<p>To get a full overview of the changes between the versions, you can <a href="../svnlog.txt">view
the full TOPALi version history</a> from the subversion server.</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="#v216">New since version 2.16</a></li>
  <li><a href="#v215">New since version 2.15</a></li>  

</ul>

<img style="width: 469px; height: 260px;" alt="" src="printpreview.jpg" /><br />
<br />



<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mouse over highlighting</span><br />

<br />
The sequence and position is now highlighted, as you move your mouse
across the alignment. You can highlight regions and select the
according sequences or add the according position as partition. This
feature is also used during VAMSAS sessions to synchronize alignment
views between different application.<br />

<img style="width: 707px; height: 319px;" alt="" src="mouseover.jpg" />



<span style="font-weight: bold;">Positive Selection
analysis</span><br />
<br />
TOPALi now provides a intuitive interface to CodeML (part of <a href="http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html" target="_blank">PAML</a>), making positive selection analysis much more convenient.

<br />

<img style="width: 552px; height: 412px;" alt="" src="codeml1.jpg" /><img style="width: 572px; height: 414px;" alt="" src="codeml2.jpg" /><br />



<span style="font-weight: bold;">New tree estimation
methods</span><br />
<br />
The Jukes-Cantor model for quick tree estimation was replaced with the
more sophisticated F84+Gamma model. TOPALi also offers different tree
estimation methods, like Maximum Liklihood (using <a href="http://atgc.lirmm.fr/phyml/" target="_blank">PhyML</a>) or bayesian tree estimation (using <a href="http://mrbayes.csit.fsu.edu/" target="_blank">MrBayes</a>), where also allows further tuning of the tree-creation parameters.<br />

<br />

<img style="width: 346px; height: 209px;" alt="" src="tree1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img style="width: 321px; height: 288px;" alt="" src="tree2.jpg" />



<span style="font-weight: bold;">Nucleotide/Aminoacid
Substitution Model selection</span>

<br />
To find out which substitution model your alignment fits best, TOPALi now offers model testing using <a href="http://bioinf.may.ie/software/modelgenerator/" target="_blank">Modelgenerator</a>.<br />
<br />

<img style="width: 432px; height: 262px;" alt="" src="modelgenerator.jpg" />

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
Ancestral sequence
estimation</span><br />

<br />
In order to estimate ancestral sequences, you can now run <a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/%7Etalp/supplementary/fastml/fastml.2.02.htm" target="_blank">FastML</a>'s ancestral sequence estimation directly from a tree created in TOPALi.<br />

<img style="width: 533px; height: 324px;" alt="" src="ancestral.jpg" /><br />

<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Codon Usage Check</span><br />
<br />
For many analyses it is important to check the codon usage beforehand. Therefore you can now launch <a href="http://codonw.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">CodonW</a> from within TOPALi.<br />
<br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 310px; height: 206px;" alt="" src="codonw.jpg" /><br />

<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">VAMSAS support</span><br />

<br />
TOPALi now mostly supports the <a href="http://www.vamsas.ac.uk/" target="_blank">VAMSAS</a> API, which enables different bioinformatics applications to work together. Currently <a href="http://www.jalview.org/" target="_blank">Jalview</a> and VAMAV support VAMSAS.<br />
<br />

<img style="width: 478px; height: 196px;" alt="" src="vamsas.jpg" /><br />

<br />


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cluster queue monitoring</span><br />
<p>
TOPALi's monitoring of the cluster where your job has been submitted now shows how many jobs
are in the queue in front of you.

<h2><a name="v215"></a>New since version 2.15 and earlier</h2>

<p><b>New and improved graphical user interface</b>
</p>

<p>TOPALi v2 sports an entirely new graphical user interface that
has been redesigned from scratch
to improve upon the original TOPALi's interface. On Windows, the
interface blends in with Office
using the Office Look and Feel, while on Unix or Linux the popular
JGoodies "Looks" is used.</p>

<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="trainline"></p>

<p><b>Work with multiple, multiple alignments</b>
</p>

<p>A TOPALi project can now import and deal with as many
DNA/Protein alignments as your PC has
memory for. Each alignment in listed in a new "tree" view down the
left-hand side of the screen,
along with all the analysis results that relate to that dataset.</p>

<p><img src="multiple_alignments.png" alt="TOPALi screenshot" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="trainline"></p>

<p><b>XML based project structure</b>
</p>

<p>TOPALi now uses a XML based structure for its project files
(which are stored compressed),
allowing for better compatibility with other programs that want to
share its data.</p>

<p><img src="xml.png" alt="TOPALi screenshot" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="trainline"></p>

<p><b>Run analysis jobs remotely on high-performance
computing clusters</b>
</p>

<p>TOPALi now runs its main analysis jobs on remote HPC clusters,
which frees up your PC for
other tasks while you wait on results. You can submit more than one job
at a time too, and
they'll queue up for running later if no slots are currently available
on the cluster. However, you can get the binaries and run jobs locally
on your PC, too.</p>

<p><img src="jobs.png" alt="TOPALi screenshot" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="trainline"></p>

<p><b>Monitor analysis jobs while working elsewhere</b>
</p>

<p>As your analysis jobs run (either locally or remotely) their
status is continually tracked
by TOPALi and displayed in the status bar. A coloured icon represents
overall job status - green
for OK, blue for communication errors, and red for critical job errors!</p>

<p><img src="status_monitoring.png" alt="TOPALi screenshot" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="trainline"></p>

<p><b>Integrated JavaHelp user manual</b>
</p>

<p>The user manual for TOPALi v2 is now integrated into the
application in JavaHelp format,
allowing you to easily move between help sections or to print areas of
interest.</p>

<p><img src="javahelp1.png" alt="TOPALi screenshot" /></p>

<p>All TOPALi dialogs now have access to the help system directly
from the dialog, which will
jump you straight to the relevant section of help for that dialog.</p>

<p><img src="javahelp2.png" alt="TOPALi screenshot" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="trainline"></p>

<p><b>TOPALi Tips!</b>
</p>

<p>Each area of the TOPALi interface now comes with tips to help
you work more effectively with
it, requiring less visits to the help system to learn to use the
program.</p>

<p><img src="topali_tips.png" alt="TOPALi screenshot" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="trainline"></p>

<p><b>Alignment Overviews</b>
</p>

<p>Using the Alignment Overview feature you can view the entire
alignment in a floating
window while still working with a close up area in detail. Scrolling
around the overview
automatically moves the main display too.</p>

<p><img src="overview.png" alt="TOPALi screenshot" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="trainline"></p>

<p><b>Dim unselected sequences</b>
</p>

<p>By ticking the option in the Display Settings, you can have
TOPALi dim sequences that
are not currently selected, making it easier to focus on those that are.</p>

<p><img src="dimseqs.png" alt="TOPALi screenshot" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="trainline"></p>

<p><b>Floating Tree Tooltips</b>
</p>

<p>By using floating tree tooltips, you can instantly view a
phylogenetic tree of the area
currently under the mouse cursor.</p>

<p><img src="tree_tooltips1.png" alt="TOPALi screenshot" /></p>

<p>Enable the feature (on a per-graph basis) using the toolbar
button for that graph</p>

<p><img src="tree_tooltips2.png" alt="TOPALi screenshot" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="trainline"></p>

<p><b>Support for authenticating proxy servers</b>
</p>

<p>If you are behind a proxy server that controls your access to
the internet, TOPALi can be
set to send all its internet requests through this machine. Support for
proxies that require
authentication (including NTLM) is included.</p>

<p><img src="proxy.png" alt="TOPALi screenshot" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="trainline"></p>

<p><b>Drag and drop support</b>
</p>

<p>On supported systems, you can use standard drag and drop
operations to load alignments
or TOPALi projects into the application. TOPALi supports dragging and
dropping of more
than one alignment at a time too.</p>

<p><img src="dragdrop.png" alt="TOPALi screenshot" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="trainline"></p>

<p><b>Combine cDNA and guide protein into an alignment</b>
</p>

<p>Protein multiple alignment algorithms produce better results
than do DNA multiple
alignment algorithms. TOPALi now allows you to create a DNA alignment
by using the data
from cDNA and a guide protein alignment when importing a new dataset.</p>

<p><img src="cdna.png" alt="TOPALi screenshot" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="trainline"></p>

<p><b>Create groups from trees and extract representatives</b>
</p>

<p>You can use tree similarities to group clusters of sequences
that are close to
one another in a phylogenetic tree (similar sequences are coloured the
same). A guide
sequence from each group can then be selected in the original dataset.</p>

<p><img src="clustering.png" alt="TOPALi screenshot" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New
Recombination Method: Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><img style="width: 632px; height: 374px;" alt="" src="lrt.jpg" /></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="trainline"></p>

<p><b>Run multiple jobs in parallel</b>
</p>

<p>TOPALi now has full support for multi-processor and multi-core machines, so
if you have 2, 4, or more CPUs at your disposal then TOPALi can run jobs on all
of them at once, or split a single job so that it runs in parallel across them
all (and completes faster). You can also limit the total number of CPUs available
to TOPALi, perhaps to keep a CPU free for non-TOPALi tasks.</p>

<p><img src="parallel.png" alt="TOPALi screenshot" /></p>
