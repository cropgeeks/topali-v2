<h1>Model Selection</h1>
Model Selection is done running PhyML on each model (in parallel on clusters 
or multi-core machines). 
<br><br>
Three different scores will be calculated:
<ul>
<li>Akaike information criterion (AIC1): -2lnl + 2df</li>
<li>AIC with second order correction (AIC2): -2lnl + 2df + 2df(df+1)/(n-df-1)</li>
<li>Bayesian information criterion (BIC): -2lnl + df * log(n)</li>
</ul>
(lnl: log likelihood; df: degrees of freedom (model + tree); n: sample size)<br>
You can choose the parameter 'n' either to be the sequence length or the alignment size.
<br><br>
The result table will be sorted in ascending order according to the BIC score 
(the best model has the lowest score). You can sort the table in ascending/descending order
according to each score by clicking on the appropriate column header.<br>
In brackets after the scores the Robinson Foulds distance for the best model versus all models is
shown (AIC1 column: best AIC model vs. all; AIC2 column: best AIC2 model vs. all; BIC column: best BIC model
vs. all).
<br><br>
If you choose Model Selection for PhyML the following models will be tested.<br><br>
For DNA alignments:<br>

<br>
(gray: fixed values; color: estimated values)

<br><br>
For Protein alignments:<br>

<br>
(all values fixed)
<br><br>
For both (DNA and protein) model types Model Selection will also test for rate heterogenity (proportion 
if invariable sites and gamma distribution), if you selected these options.<br>

<br>
(red: Proportion of invariable sites; blue: Gamma distribution)
<br><br>
Model Selection for MrBayes will test a subset of the above models.
<br><br>

The best model according to the BIC score will be selected automatically
as default model for the alignment Model Selection was run with. You can change this by selecting
a model in the Model Selection result and click on 'Select' button next to the model details.
<br><br>
The best model with regard to AIC1, AIC2 and BIC score will be highlighted in the according row.<br>
If you run Model Selection on a DNA alignment, also the best models with regard to various likelihood
ratio tests will be highlighted in the likelihood column.
