<h1>Selecting Sequences</h1>

<p>When an alignment is first imported into TOPALi, all of its sequences are selected by
default. However, certain tasks (such as the creation of phylogenetic trees,
the recombination detection methods, etc) may require an exact number of sequences to be
selected that differs from the number contained in the alignment. You may also wish
to only analyze certain sequences.</p>

<p><b>Manually selecting sequences:</b><br>
To select sequences, click their names with the mouse.
<ul>
  <li>A single click will select only that sequence.</li>
  <li>Holding CTRL while selecting will select each sequence in turn.</li>
  <li>Holding SHIFT while selecting will select a group of sequences.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Automatically selecting sequences</b><br>
You can also select groups of sequences using the <b>Alignment | Select Sequences</b>
menu options. Here you can:
<ul>
  <li>Select all sequences.</li>
  <li>Deselect all sequences (select none).</li>
  <li>Select only those sequences that are unique.</li>
  <li>Invert the current selection (selected become unselected and vice versa).</li>
</ul>
</p>
