<h1>Importing Alignments</h1>

<p>To import an alignment into TOPALi, select <b>File | Import Alignment</b> from the
menu bar. This brings up the <b>Import Alignment</b> dialog.</p>

<p>From here, you can choose to either import an alignment directly, or to import an
alignment by first creating one by using <a href="makena.html">unaligned cDNA and a
guide protein alignment</a>.</p>

<p>TOPALi can currently import alignments that are in formats supported by the
popular ReadSeq program. Basic, FASTA formatted files are loaded directly by
TOPALi - all other formats are handed off to an external ReadSeq web service
to be converted into a format that TOPALi does understand.

<p>If you would like support added for an alignment file format that TOPALi can
not handle, then please get in touch with us at topali (at) bioss.ac.uk</p>
