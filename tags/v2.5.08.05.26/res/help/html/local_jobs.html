<h1>Running Jobs Locally</h1>

<p>TOPALi is designed to run its analysis methods on remote high-performance compute clusters,
however, there may be times when you wish to run jobs locally on your own machine.</p>

<p><b>Note, to run jobs locally you must be using an installed version of TOPALi, not the
webstart version.</b></p>

<p><b>Compile Binaries (non Windows systems only)</b><br>
Change to the directory where TOPALi was installed, and cd into binaries/src and run
"sh compileprogs". This will compile each of the external programs that TOPALi uses.</p>

<p><b>CTRL-click Run Buttons</b><br>
To submit jobs locally, simply hold down the CTRL key when pressing "Run" on
any analysis job's settings dialog.</p>

<p>You should note that locally submitted jobs do not act in the same way as remotely submitted
jobs. They can be cancelled, but their state cannot be saved as part of a project. If a project
is saved while a local job is running, the job will restart from the beginning the next time
that project is opened. Also, any local jobs in progress when a new project is created or an
existing project is loaded will be automatically cancelled.</p>
